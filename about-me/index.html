          I found web development a bit by accident. While taking a break, I was invited into a tech firm from the back alley of a caf&eacute; I worked at. By the time I walked out they had offered me an internship... It was presented to me a bit like a secret, or as if I had found treasure buried in the back yard. Once discovered there was no turning back. I was, and have been, consumed by my passion for web since.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          My passion developed from the artistic side. I guess one could say I have been &#34;publicly-proclaimed&#34; an artist due to the fact that I post work my illustration work a few times a week, and that&#39;s what many people associate me with. I jumped into CSS, and hit the ground running. I like to look at the web as an untapped medium and its my job to learn how to master my tools, and languages.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          My problem in the beginning was that I was unchallenged at my first internship, and praised for the simple work I was doing. I could tell this was detracting from my progress, so I left and moved to Washington State to build my first site for someone besides myself.
        Once that roller coaster of a job ended I moved down to San Diego to spend time with my mother, and got a job at the agency I am currently at.

          Working in an enterprise environment at this pace was a big wake up call for me. I learned, being around other web developers, that I knew nothing. This was exciting and terrifying at at the same time. Exciting because everyday I learning more and more, but terrifying because I was struggling to keep up with the workload. My personality type doesn&#39;t like to fail. I worked overtime throughout my first 3 months, and soon I was being respected as one of the senior employees.

          <br/>
          Throughout my time at Taylor &amp; Pond I have worked primarily with the schools we&#39;re associated with. I helped build out templates and transfer content through the OmniUpdate for the new San Diego Mesa College website. I am the webmaster for San Diego City College&#39;s website, which runs on DotNetNuke. I am also part of the Herbalife Development team, which builds and customizes templates for hundreds of Herbalife sites in hundreds of languages though Wordpress.  I do most of the banner designs for San Diego City College, which are featured on the homepage. I have also been able to dabble in AspDotNetStorefront for minx cosmetics.

          Things have moved very fast and in the process I have proven to myself, without a doubt, that this is what I want to do for the rest of my life. Things are to the point with my current company were I am spending 2-3 hours a night teaching myself. Although I have always studied in my off-time, it has become more of a primary focus as a means to leave to discover life&#39;s next challenge.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Working as a web content specialist, I may not be presented with the biggest challenge, but I hope to get involved with my dream company. In doing so I might have the opportunity to come on as one of the front-end developers in the future.
